# ☕ My Java Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is my personal, open-source notebook as I dive deep into the world of Java. It's a place to document my progress, store code snippets, and build small projects, from "Hello, World!" to more advanced concepts.

## 🎯 About This Journey

As a Computer Science Master's student, I am building a strong foundation in Java. This repository serves as a living document of my learning, a practical reference for my future self, and a way to share my progress with the community.

My goal is to explore:
* Core Java fundamentals
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
* Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
* Common frameworks and libraries in the Java ecosystem (like Spring)

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

I'll be updating this section as I progress. The checkmarks will track what I've covered.

### Phase 1: The Essentials
- [ ] **Java Basics:** Syntax, Variables, Data Types, and Operators.
- [ ] **Control Flow:** `if-else`, `switch`, `for`, `while` loops.
- [ ] **Core APIs:** `String`, `Math`, `Arrays`.
- [ ] **Methods:** Writing and using functions.

### Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] **Classes & Objects:** The foundation of OOP.
- [ ] **The Four Pillars:**
    - [ ] Encapsulation
    - [ ] Inheritance
    - [ ] Polymorphism
    - [ ] Abstraction (Abstract Classes & Interfaces)
- [ ] **Constructors & Keywords:** `this`,
